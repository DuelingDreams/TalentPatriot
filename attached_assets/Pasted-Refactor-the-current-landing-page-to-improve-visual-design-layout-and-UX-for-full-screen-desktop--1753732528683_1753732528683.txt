Refactor the current landing page to improve visual design, layout, and UX for full-screen (desktop/web) users. Follow these updated design guidelines and style rules:

🔹 LAYOUT STRUCTURE
1. HERO SECTION (Top of page)
   - Add large H1: “The Simple ATS + CRM Built for Growing Teams”
   - Add subheading: “Stop losing track of candidates and start hiring smarter.”
   - Add two buttons side by side:
     - Primary CTA: “Start Free”
     - Secondary CTA: “Book a Demo”
   - Include a responsive placeholder image or video section (to be replaced later).
   - Center all content in a full-width, light background (#F7F9FC) container.

2. WHO IT’S FOR SECTION
   - Title: “Built for Busy Recruiters, Founders, and Hiring Managers”
   - Add 3 icon-text blocks horizontally (responsive for mobile):
     - Recruiters: “Track candidates and communication in one place.”
     - Founders: “Stay in the loop — even if you don’t have a hiring team.”
     - Hiring Managers: “Ditch the spreadsheet. See the pipeline at a glance.”

3. FEATURES SECTION
   - Title: “Everything You Need — Nothing You Don’t”
   - Use 3–4 icon + text columns showing key features:
     - Drag-and-drop pipelines
     - Candidate profiles
     - Notes and reminders
     - CRM-lite for contacts

4. SCREENSHOT/VIDEO SECTION (placeholder for now)
   - Add a responsive image/video container
   - Use a mockup container with rounded corners and shadow

5. CTA SECTION
   - Title: “Start Hiring Smarter Today”
   - Centered buttons again:
     - “Start Free”
     - “Book a Demo”

🔹 STYLING + COLOR SYSTEM
Apply consistent modern styling with the following:

Typography:
- Use `Inter, sans-serif` throughout
- H1: 36–40px, bold, `#1A1A1A`
- Subhead: 24px, medium, `#1F3A5F`
- Body: 16px, `#5C667B`

Color Palette:
- Primary: `#1F3A5F` (for headings, primary buttons)
- Accent: `#264C99` (hover states, links)
- Background: `#F7F9FC`
- Secondary Text: `#5C667B`

Button Styling:
- Primary:
  - Background: `#1F3A5F`
  - Text: white
  - Padding: `px-6 py-3`
  - Rounded: `rounded-md`
  - Hover: `bg-[#264C99]`

- Secondary:
  - Border: `1px solid #264C99`
  - Text: `#264C99`
  - Hover: `bg-[#E6F0FF]`

🔹 ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Ensure responsiveness for mobile screens using media queries or Tailwind breakpoints.
- Use appropriate spacing and section padding (`py-12`, `px-6`) for breathing room.
- Do not yet add testimonials or trust logos — placeholder space is okay.

Update the landing page code to reflect this professional layout and styling system. Refactor HTML/CSS/JS as needed to clean up old classes or unused styles.
