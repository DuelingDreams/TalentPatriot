Title: Remove unused job components and wire up the correct UI pages

Instructions:

Identify and remove unused files.

Delete these files because they are no longer part of the final design:

client/src/components/jobs/GuidedJobCreation.tsx – a demo wizard that doesn’t call the real API.

client/src/pages/PublicJobsList.tsx – a duplicate jobs list page.

client/src/pages/PublicJobDetail.tsx – an outdated detail page with a single name field.

Search the codebase (grep or VS Code “Find All”) for any imports of these files. Replace them with the correct components:

Replace GuidedJobCreation with PostJobDialog wherever used.

Use Careers.tsx for the public jobs list.

Use CareersBySlug.tsx (and JobApplicationForm.tsx for the apply page) for public job details instead of PublicJobDetail.tsx.

Update routes and imports.

Check your router configuration (e.g., client/src/App.tsx or wherever routes are defined). Remove references to PublicJobsList and PublicJobDetail.

Ensure the /careers path renders Careers.tsx.

Ensure the job detail route (/careers/:slug) renders CareersBySlug.tsx.

For full applications, ensure /careers/:slug/apply uses JobApplicationForm.tsx.

Clean up unused assets.

If the removed components have associated CSS or images, delete those files too.

Verify UI wiring.

Run npm run lint to catch any unresolved imports after deleting the files.

Run npm run dev and confirm:

The Jobs dashboard still loads, allows draft creation, publishes jobs, and the pipeline view works.

The public careers page (/careers) lists published jobs.

Clicking a job navigates to /careers/{slug} and shows details via CareersBySlug.tsx.

The quick apply is no longer exposed or is replaced by the correct JobApplicationForm.tsx.

Commit your changes.

Create a branch called refactor/remove-unused-job-pages.

Commit the deletions and any updated imports or routes.

Push and open a PR explaining that you removed unused components and connected the correct pages to avoid confusion and broken flows.
