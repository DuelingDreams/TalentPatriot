You are a development assistant for the TalentPatriot app. Your task is to update the app's reports and analytics dashboard to use the new `v_candidate_skills_flattened` view, which now pulls real candidate skills from the `candidates` table instead of demo/test data.

Instructions:

1. **Update backend queries**:
   - Replace any references to `v_candidate_skills_summary` with `v_candidate_skills_flattened`.
   - Ensure queries select the following columns:
       - `skill_name` (for individual skills)
       - `skill_category` (for grouping/aggregating)
       - `candidate_id` (for counts)
       - Optional: `candidate_name`, `experience_level`, `total_years_experience` as needed
   - Update aggregations for:
       - Top skills in demand
       - Hire rate by skill category
       - Candidate skill breakdown tables

2. **Update frontend components/charts**:
   - Top Skills in Demand → show `skill_name` and count of unique candidates.
   - Hire Rate by Skill Category → aggregate by `skill_category`.
   - Candidate skill tables → display individual skills and categories correctly.
   - Ensure charts and tables display real candidates only, not demo data.

3. **Verify data flow**:
   - Query the view directly: `SELECT * FROM public.v_candidate_skills_flattened LIMIT 10;`
   - Confirm that real candidates from all organizations are appearing with their skills.
   - Ensure dashboard charts update correctly with this real data.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add notes in the code or README explaining that `v_candidate_skills_flattened` now pulls from the `candidates` table.
   - Include a note that demo candidates exist separately and should not appear in production reports.

Constraints:
- Do not modify the underlying `candidates` table.
- Ensure that all changes are safe and do not break existing dashboards.
- Keep the app compatible with small business and boutique staffing workflows.

SQL reference for the new view:

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.v_candidate_skills_flattened;

CREATE VIEW public.v_candidate_skills_flattened AS
SELECT
    c.id AS candidate_id,
    c.name AS candidate_name,
    c.email,
    c.experience_level,
    c.total_years_experience,
    array_length(c.skills, 1) AS total_skills_count,
    skill AS skill_name,
    CASE
        WHEN skill ILIKE ANY (ARRAY['Python','Java','C++','JavaScript','TypeScript','Go','PHP','Ruby']) THEN 'Programming Language'
        WHEN skill ILIKE ANY (ARRAY['AWS','Azure','GCP','Kubernetes','Docker','Terraform']) THEN 'Cloud / DevOps'
        WHEN skill ILIKE ANY (ARRAY['React','Angular','Vue','Node.js','Django','Spring']) THEN 'Framework / Library'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS skill_category,
    c.created_at,
    c.updated_at
FROM candidates c
JOIN LATERAL unnest(c.skills) AS skill ON true
WHERE c.skills IS NOT NULL;
