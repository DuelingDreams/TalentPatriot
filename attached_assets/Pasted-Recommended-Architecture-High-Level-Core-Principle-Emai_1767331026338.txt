Recommended Architecture (High-Level)
Core Principle

Email is not a standalone feature
It must always be anchored to:

✅ Candidate

✅ Job (optional but preferred)

✅ Thread / conversation

✅ Google message ID

Think:

“Email is a first-class object that lives inside the candidate profile.”

📌 Candidate Profile → Emails Tab (Primary Surface)

Tabs

[ Profile ] [ Resume ] [ Pipeline ] [ Emails ] [ Notes ]

Emails Tab Layout (From the Mockup)

Top Bar

📩 Emails

Send Email (primary CTA)

Filters

Job

Date range

Sent / Received

Internal / Email / Client Portal

Threaded Timeline

Chronological

Grouped by subject + Gmail thread ID

Shows:

Template used (if any)

Job context

Sent vs received

✉️ Compose Email (Template-Driven)

This matches your example screenshots almost exactly.

Template Selector (First Action)
Use Email Template ▾


Templates:

Schedule Phone Screen

Request Additional Info

Not Moving Forward

Offer Letter

Reference Check Request

Selecting a template:

Auto-fills Subject

Auto-fills Body

Injects merge fields

🧩 Email Template System (How to Model It)
email_templates table
id
org_id
name
subject_template
body_template
category
is_active
created_at

Merge Fields (Simple + Powerful)
{{candidate.first_name}}
{{candidate.last_name}}
{{job.title}}
{{company.name}}
{{recruiter.name}}
{{interview.link}}


💡 Render server-side before send for auditability.

📨 Sending + Syncing (Critical Part)
When recruiter clicks Send

You should:

Render final email with merge fields

Send via Google Gmail API

Capture:

gmail_message_id

gmail_thread_id

Store email record locally

emails table
id
candidate_id
job_id
gmail_message_id
gmail_thread_id
direction -- sent | received
subject
body
sent_at
created_by


This enables:

Full threading

Reply / forward

Audit history

Multi-job visibility

🔁 Incoming Email Sync

Via Gmail webhook / polling:

Match by thread_id

Attach to candidate

Auto-appear in Emails tab

Mark unread / replied

This is what makes TalentPatriot feel “alive” instead of transactional.

⏱️ Advanced Actions (Already in Mockup)

From the composer:

📅 Schedule for later

💾 Save draft

📎 Attach files (offer letters, PDFs)

From threads:

Reply

Forward

Schedule follow-up task

🧠 Why This Design Works for Small & Boutique Firms

No separate “email module”

No CRM-style inbox complexity

Everything lives where recruiters already are

Templates reduce cognitive load

Google remains source of truth

This feels modern, lightweight, and recruiter-native.
